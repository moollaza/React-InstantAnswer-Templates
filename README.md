# DuckDuckHack IA Template Experiments

A sandbox for me to test ideas...There's not much to see here...

## To use

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!

## Changing the port

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking the script above:

```sh
PORT=3001 node server.js
```
